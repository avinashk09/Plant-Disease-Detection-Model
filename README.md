Developed a deep learning model for plant disease detection using Keras. Preprocessed the leaf dataset with Kerasâ€™s ImageDataGenerator for augmentation and normalization. Built and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for accurate disease classification. The model was evaluated for performance and deployed for real-time plant health monitoring.
Data Preprocessing: Utilized Keras's ImageDataGenerator for image augmentation and normalization to prepare the leaf dataset.
Model Development: Designed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras to classify plant diseases.
Evaluation: Achieved a training accuracy of 98.5% and a validation accuracy of 95.5%. Further evaluated the model using a confusion matrix to assess its performance in detail.
